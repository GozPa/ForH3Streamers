# ForH3Streamers
Program that should help Heroes 3 streamers in setting up their overlay with game information.

I want to create an app that shows a graphic representation of Heroes 3 players that can be used by streamers.
This means that I want to create an app that:
1) shows names of the players,
2) shows which colour was picked by which player,
3) shows what amount of gold was paid by each player,
4) shows which template is being played.
